The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.'''\n",

    "An example of abstraction is a car dashboard. When you drive a car, you don't need to understand how the engine works or how the fuel injectors function. Instead, you have a dashboard that abstracts away all of these details and provides you with a simple set of controls that you can use to operate the vehicle. The dashboard abstracts away the complex workings of the car and presents you with a simplified interface.\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "An example of encapsulation is a class in object-oriented programming. A class is a container for data and functions that are related to each other. The data is stored inside the class and is hidden from outside code. Instead of accessing the data directly, outside code interacts with the class by calling its functions. The functions inside the class can access and modify the data, but outside code cannot. This encapsulation allows the class to maintain the integrity of its data and ensures that it is not modified in unexpected ways.\n",
